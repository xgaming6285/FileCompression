This is a test file for the Huffman compression algorithm.
It contains repeating patterns and characters to demonstrate the efficiency of Huffman coding.
The more repetitive the content, the better the compression ratio will be.
Huffman coding assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters, making it very efficient for text compression.
