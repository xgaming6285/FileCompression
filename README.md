  - 🔄 Run-Length Encoding (RLE) (good for files with repeated sequences)
  - 🔍 LZ77 compression (general purpose algorithm)
  - ⚡ Parallel versions of each algorithm for multi-core systems
  - 🔒 Encrypted compression with LZ77

- **⚙️ Performance options:**
  - 📦 Large file support with chunk-based processing
  - 🚀 Optimization modes (speed vs. compression ratio)
  - 🧵 Multi-threaded compression/decompression
  - 📏 Configurable buffer sizes

- **🛠️ Additional capabilities:**
  - 📊 Built-in profiling for performance analysis
  - ✅ File integrity verification
  - 📈 Progress reporting for large files

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project consists of several modules:

## 📝 Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start (Windows)

The `compress.bat` script provides easy access to common operations:

```cmd
# Compress a file with Huffman coding
compress.bat compress huffman test.txt

# Decompress a file
compress.bat decompress huffman test.txt.huf output.txt

# Compress using parallel LZ77
compress.bat compress lz77-parallel largefile.txt

# Compress with encryption
compress.bat compress lz77-encrypted myfile.txt mypassword
```

### 💻 Command Line Interface

```
filecompressor [options] <input_file> [output_file]
```

#### ⚙️ Options

- `-c [algorithm]`  Compress using specified algorithm (0-6)
- `-d [algorithm]`  Decompress the input file
- `-a`              List available compression algorithms
- `-t [threads]`    Number of threads to use (default: auto)
- `-k [key]`        Encryption key for secure algorithms
- `-O [goal]`       Optimization goal: speed or size
- `-B [size]`       Buffer size in bytes (default: 8192)
- `-L`              Enable large file mode for files > available RAM
- `-p`              Enable profiling
- `-h`              Display help message

#### 🔢 Algorithm Selection

Use the algorithm index or let the program deduce it from the file extension:

| Index | Algorithm | Best For | File Extension |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 0 | 📚 Huffman | Text files | .huf |
| 1 | 🔄 RLE | Repetitive data | .rle |
| 2 | ⚡📚 Parallel Huffman | Large text files | .hufp |
| 3 | ⚡🔄 Parallel RLE | Large repetitive data | .rlep |
| 4 | 🔍 LZ77 | General purpose | .lz77 |
| 5 | ⚡🔍 Parallel LZ77 | Large general files | .lz77p |
| 6 | 🔒🔍 Encrypted LZ77 | Secure data | .lz77e |

### 📋 Examples

```bash
# Compress text file with Huffman
filecompressor -c 0 document.txt

# Decompress Huffman file
filecompressor -d document.txt.huf

# Compress image with LZ77 optimized for better compression
filecompressor -c 4 -O size -B 16384 image.raw

# Process large video file with parallel processing
filecompressor -c 5 -L -B 1048576 -t 4 video.raw

# Secure compression with encryption
filecompressor -c 6 -k "my_secure_password" confidential.txt
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

- 📦 For large files (>1GB), use `-L` to enable chunk-based processing
- ⚡ For multi-core systems, use parallel algorithms (2, 3, or 5)
- 💨 Increase buffer size (`-B`) for better throughput on SSDs
- ⚖️ Use `-O speed` for faster compression, `-O size` for better compression ratio
- 🏎️ For maximum speed, use RLE with `-O speed`
- 🗜️ For best compression ratio, use Huffman with `-O size`

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- 💾 If you encounter "out of memory" errors, enable large file mode (`-L`)
- 🛠️ For corrupted output, ensure no partial writes occurred during compression
- 🔄 If decompression fails, verify you're using the same algorithm as compression
